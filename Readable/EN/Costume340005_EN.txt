<center>—Curtains Rise—</center>
<center>O holiest of sovereigns, high princess of Immernachtreich!</center>
<center>Praise her eminent rule, extol her magnanimous judgment, exalted be her rosy visage.</center>
<center>The thunder roars for her, and for her are towers built.</center>
<center>The fief-lords of Immernachtreich and The Great Sekretär, most loyal Osvaldo Hrafnavins, gather here to await her command.</center>
<center>And her knights, silent and stern as the majestic mountains.</center>
<center>The first, the Knight of Valor, armed with a sword of keenness unmatched, yea, enough to sunder dragonscale.</center>
<center>The second, the Knight of Sincerity, shod in armor true, enough to withstand the storm of a dragon's wings.</center>
<center>The third, the Knight of Charity, righteous and pure in all ways, who quailed not before any darkness.</center>
<center>And the other knights gathered behind them, their heads bowed beneath the tower summit, gathered at their Prinzessin's feet.</center>
<center>And as for the Prinzessin, she withdrew her gaze from the deep night before addressing her servants:</center>
<center>"Valor, Sincerity, Charity, my most excellent subjects. Follow me unto eternity."</center>
<center>"For I am the noblest soul in all the Immernachtreich. So long as my heart beats, I shall never forsake you."</center>
<center>And the knights obeyed her:</center>
<center>"Our swords and armor are yours. May they be for you a means to break all shackles and guard against all corruption."</center>
<center>"Our true hearts also we give unto you, that they may defend your noble soul."</center>
<center>This was their knightly oath, and they would be by her side as she hunted the wicked dragon Tasraque.</center>

<center>For far away, black-hearted Tasraque had ripped and devoured the all-protecting night sky and set up its lair.</center>
<center>It had slithered in the dark, sharpening its fangs and claws, and with its flaming breath it had scorched the Prinzessin's heart, turning her eyes red.</center>
<center>This was the Prinzessin's fated foe, and their showdown was inevitable.</center>
<center>But the prophecy of fate has already been foretold. Fair and pure souls need not fret.</center>
<center>Simply open one's eyes and prepare to bear witness, for she shall surely return victorious.</center>
<center>—Curtains Fall—</center>
